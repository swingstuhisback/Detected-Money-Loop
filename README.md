## Instructions

1. **Set up the menu, install LUA.**

   **I won't be providing help or any instructions on installing YimMenu.**
    Drag the .lua file into YimMenu's scripts folder. This is also accessible in the menu itself.
    Settings -> Lua Scripts -> Open Lua Scripts Folder

2. **Load into online and run the script**

   Once you've set everything up, load up GTA:O, go out onto the streets and click the Reload All button in YimMenu.
   The LUA should be automatically loaded.

   Navigate to **Detected Money Loop** under **Settings** and click **Enable Loop** once you're ready. The script should generate around ~$800K every 3-4 seconds.

3. **Profit**

    You are now rich. Enjoy your account, it only has 3 days left.
